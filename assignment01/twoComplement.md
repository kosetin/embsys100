# Why use twoâ€™s complement to represent negative numbers? #
Representing negative numbers as two's complement allows performing basic mathematical operations in fewer steps.
- adding/subtracting a negative number represented as two's complement does not require checking the sign bit nor adding the end-around carry.
- Sign extension of a number represented as two's complement e.g. from a 4-bit to a 8-bit representation can be achieved by padding with the most significant ("sign") bit.
- Avoids ambiguity when representing zero.
